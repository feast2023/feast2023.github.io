    "text": "The grammars of signed languages are as highly complex as the grammars of spoken languages and share with them many universal features, despite the difference in modality between spoken languages (which use the auditory channel) and signed languages (which use the visual channel). Yet, sign languages also differ from spoken languages in radical ways: morphological information in sign languages is often conveyed simultaneously by different articulators rather than linearly; moreover, certain aspects of their phonological, syntactic and semantic structures are not commonly found in spoken languages. These differences raise an interesting challenge both for formal linguistic and experimental research frameworks."

    "text": "Travel & Accommodation\n\nTravel to Bergen\nBergen is most easily reached by air travel, with the airport Bergen Flesland (BGO) serving multiple domestic and international destinations. The airport is located to the south-west of Bergen and the city center can be reached in about 45 mins using the tram Bybanen (using a regular public transport ticket, approximately €4 one way), 30 mins on the shuttle bus Flybussen (individual ticket, approximately €15 one way) or a private taxi (prices can vary a lot between companies, approximately €50–70 one way).\nBergen can also be reached by train from Oslo (and intermediate stops) in approximately 6 hrs, or by overnight ferry from Denmark. Domestic ferries to Bergen also exist, from e.g. Stavanger (from the south) and Trondheim and Tromsø (from the north).\n\n\nGetting around Bergen\nThe University of Bergen is a located in the very center of the city of Bergen, just next to Johanneskirken (St. John’s Church), a highly visible landmark. Central Bergen is not too big and most locations can be reached within 15 mins walking, but please note that Bergen is an old city built around hills, mountains and ridges, so streets will often be cobbled, irregular and at times quite steep, with occasional steps connecting some streets and alleys.\nThere is plenty of public transportation options in and around Bergen. The company Skyss runs the tram (Bybanen) and bus services, and tickets can be bought at tram stops or through their mobile app. There is also a network of city bikes (Bergen Bysykkel) that can be rented using a mobile app.\n\n\nAccommodation\nThere are multiple accommodation options in and around Bergen. Several hotels (boutique as well as larger chains) are located around the central parts of Bergen city center (e.g. Byparken, Bryggen, Nordnes), and there are also hostels and AirBnB options. Besides downtown Bergen, staying around the areas Sandviken (north), Årstad/Kronstad/Minde (south-east) and Damsgård/Laksevåg (south) would be within easy reach of the conference venue using public transport or even walking/biking. We suggest using regular hotel booking sites to find accommodation, e.g. Booking, Hotels or Hostelworld.\nNB: The summer months are by far the busiest tourist months in Bergen, so we strongly recommend securing accommodation as early as possible."

Two of the Seven Mountains of Bergen are accessible via funicular (Mt. Fløyen 300 m) or gondola (Mt. Ulriken 643 m), both excellent look-out spots for amazing views of the city. Summertime at the 60th latitude offers plenty of hours of daylight as the sun barely sets at night, effectively extending the days for activities. For further suggestions for activities, locations (e.g. museums) and excursions (e.g. ferries on the fjord), see the Visit Bergen website."
